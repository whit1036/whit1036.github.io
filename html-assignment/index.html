           <h2>About me!</h2>
            <p>My name is Brennan, and I was born and raised here in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. I love music, especially heavy metal, and hard rock! Some of my favorite bands are: Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Dio, Mercyful Fate, Exciter, Dream Theater, and so much more. Anything heavy and old-school is what I’m all about.</p>
            
            <p>I am a musician myself, and I play guitar! Some of my favorite guitar players are: Yngwie Malmsteen, Paul Gilbert, Jason Becker, Marty Friedman, Steve Vai, & John Petrucci! In my spare time I love to write and record original music in my home studio. I used to play live music in one of my former bands “Machine Messiah”. We frequently played venues in Ottawa such as Mavericks, The Brass Monkey, 27 Club. There’s no feeling like playing live music!</p>
