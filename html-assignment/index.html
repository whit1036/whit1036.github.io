           <h2>About me!</h2>
            <p>My name is Brennan, and I was born and raised here in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. I love music, especially heavy metal, and hard rock! Some of my favorite bands are: Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Dio, Mercyful Fate, Exciter, Dream Theater, and so much more. Anything heavy and old-school is what I’m all about.</p>
            
            <p>I am a musician myself, and I play guitar! Some of my favorite guitar players are: Yngwie Malmsteen, Paul Gilbert, Jason Becker, Marty Friedman, Steve Vai, & John Petrucci! In my spare time I love to write and record original music in my home studio. I used to play live music in one of my former bands “Machine Messiah”. We frequently played venues in Ottawa such as Mavericks, The Brass Monkey, & The 27 Club. There’s no feeling like playing live music!</p>

            <p>I am also a guitar gearhead, and I personally own lots of vintage and high-end gear and digital plugins that I use in my digital audio workstation. My favorite combo is my Gibson Les Paul Classic plugged into my 100w Marshall JMP-1 rig through a vintage 1987 Marshall 4x12 cab, however, I do own a few vintage Ibanez RG550 <abbr title="Made in Japan">MIJ</abbr> guitars that I play through my Axe-FX II that I run into my power amp and into my 2x12 Mesa Rectifier cab. Tone heaven!</p>

            <p>I have had the opportunity to record several albums with local friends and artists around the world. One of my bands “Devil Cross” just released a brand-new record on Fighter Records called “This Mortal Coil”, released on December 7<sup>th</sup>2021! It can be found on streaming platforms, as well as CD/Vinyl. We plan to release a new record next year on Fighter Records, so I’m looking forward to that release. I’m currently working on some solo, self-released music that I plan on releasing sometime in the next few years!</p>
