    <h2>The History of the Gibson Les Paul</h2>

    <p>The Gibson Les Paul electric guitar is argubely the most popular and well known musical instruments known to humankind. It's origins begin with the man himself; Lester Polsfuss, 'Les Paul'. Les was an American showbusiness actor who worked on tv with his wife 'Mary Ford' as a performing guitar duet. Les was known to experiment with musical devices at Epi Stathopoulus' (Epiphone) workshop. This was when he created the first ever solid body electric guitar dubbed 'The Log', in 1940. 10 years later, Les was finally accepted by Gibson to manufacture his creation, after Fender released their first electric guitar in 1950. The "Gibson Les Paul" guitar, made its official debut in 1952.</p>
