    <h2>The History of the Gibson Les Paul</h2>

    <p>The 'Gibson Les Paul' electric guitar is argubely one of the most well known musical instruments known to humankind. It's origins begin with the man himself; Lester Polsfuss, 'Les Paul'. Les was an American showbusiness actor who worked on tv with his wife 'Mary Ford' as a performing guitar duet. Les was known to experiment with musical devices at 'Epi Stathopoulus' (Epiphone) workshop. It was in Epi's workshop where he created the first ever solid body electric guitar dubbed 'The Log', in 1940. 10 years later, Les was finally accepted by the 'Gibson Guitar Corporation' to manufacture his creation, after 'Fender' released their first electric guitar in 1950. The Gibson Les Paul guitar, made its official debut in 1952, featuring dual 'P90' pickups & a Gold Top body. To this day, the Les Paul remains the most popular guitar choice for any player of any genre of music. This popularity stems from the incredible design that has not changed since the beginning. The sustain, playability, tone, and killer body shape of any Les Paul guitar is simply untouchable.</p>
